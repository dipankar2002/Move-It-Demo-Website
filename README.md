# Move-It-Demo-Website
This is a demo project of a simple business called "Move It".
I make the entire website using the Bootstrap which is a framework of CSS.
Also i make some changes for me in internal CSS.

That's every thing about this demo website. I make this to experience the Bootstrap Framework and practice for my upcomming projects.
